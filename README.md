## Do you have a dream or idea that can change the world?


We wanted to move away from the corporate mindset and micro-management. 
It was crucial to emphasize people. We started our initial cooperation 
on mutual respect and understanding; we wanted to spread these positive 
notions throughout our company. It is essential to create an atmosphere where our 
colleagues and employees have the opportunity to get deep fulfillment and sincere happiness.

Today 2am. technologies is an organization of system architects, project managers, developers, and 
designers. We count more than sixty people distributed throughout the world and still bring 
dreams and ideas into real, practical applications with joy and playful hearts.

*At 2am. technologies, we understand that the most profound discoveries happen when the rest of the 
world is fast asleep. That's why our team of passionate night owls is dedicated to crafting 
revolutionary technologies that shape the future. Armed with a shared vision of driving 
progress through innovation, we have joined forces to push the boundaries of what's possible.*
